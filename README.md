Hello,
I'm Satya a software engineer based in Bangalore, In.

I am building safe Agentic AI system - linear, tool callig, router based, Multi agents, RAG based all sorts of AI agents. Beyond just implementation, I love exploring the foundations of intelligence - orchestration, reasoning loops, context management, and retrieval pipelines, pushing the limits of what autonomous systems can do.

You can find me pushing code to a branch in a repo here after the professional working hours, or reading some technical or psychological artical and sometime playing Ghost of tsushima (completed twice).
